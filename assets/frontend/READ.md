Overview
This project is a React frontend prototype for an AI-powered platform that transforms healthcare software requirements into structured, compliant, and audit-ready test cases. It supports document upload, displays generated test cases, allows CSV export, and collects user feedback.

Key features:

File upload (PDF/DOCX) with validation and simulated AI processing

Display test cases in a paginated, sortable Material-UI DataGrid

Export test cases to CSV file for QA workflows

Feedback form with dummy pre-filled text for testing

Modular React components built with Material-UI for a modern UI

Architecture
Frontend built in ReactJS using hooks and Material-UI (MUI) components

Simulated backend processing for prototyping; easily replaceable with real API calls

CSV export handled entirely client-side

User feedback collected and stored in component state (extendable to backend)

Designed for integration with Google Cloud Storage, Firestore, Cloud Functions, and Vertex AI LLM

Prerequisites
Node.js (v16 or above recommended)

npm package manager

Installation
Clone repository or copy project files locally

Open terminal and navigate to project folder

Run:

bash
npm install
to install dependencies including React and Material-UI

Running the App
Start development server via:

bash
npm start
Open browser at:

text
http://localhost:3000
You can now:

Upload PDF/DOCX files (dummy processing simulates AI output)

View generated test cases in the DataGrid

Download test cases as CSV

Submit feedback with a pre-filled dummy message

Integrating Real Backend APIs
Replace dummy upload logic in FileUpload.js with real image/document upload API calls.

Send feedback data from FeedbackForm.js to real backend feedback endpoints.

Fetch stored test cases from backend if needed.

Ensure backend APIs handle GDPR, FDA, ISO compliance as per platform specification.
